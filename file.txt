Hello there!
My name is Osnat Rubin- but you can call me Osi. My hasband name is Gilad.
I teach Math and the color of our book is grey.
You know? I really love three colors- which are pink, light-blue and yellow.
We have reached page 18 till now, but my goal is to reach page two hundred and forty-three.
